.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reconciling small variations in taxonomic names is fundamental to
integrating biological data.
This too matches a query list of (parsed) taxonomic names against a
reference list, according to a set of taxonomic rules (described below).
Can also perform approximate (fuzzy) matching to identify variations in
binomial names and author strings.
.SS Input file format
.PP
Each line represents the elements of a name.
Eight pipe\-delimited (\[lq]|\[rq]) fields per row: 1.
User ID code, 2.
Genus hybrid sign (\[lq]×\[rq] = Unicode \[lq]MULTIPLICATION SIGN\[rq]
\f[C]C3\ 97\f[]), 3.
Genus, 4.
Species hybrid sign (\[lq]×\[rq]), 5.
Specific epithet, 6.
Infraspecific rank signifier (\[lq]subsp.\[rq], \[lq]var.\[rq], etc.),
7.
Infraspecific epithet, 8.
Name's author string.
.SS Output file format
.PP
Each line represents a single name from the query list (list A).
Seventeen pipe\-delimited (\[lq]|\[rq]) fields per row: 1.
User ID code in list A, 2.
Used code in list B (if matched), 3.
Match type (see codes above), 4\-10.
Parsed elements of name in list A.
11\-17 (in same format as name input), Parsed elements of name in list
B.
